It is still under development, but it will include information about:

For now, if you would like to commission anything, please DM me.

# Question About the Early Realm Version

The addon is currently in a buggy state. I originally planned to release the realm this month, but as you all know, that didn’t happen.

I’m done delaying the Realm. I want to play with people who genuinely care about my work and want to enjoy the RP experience and the features I’ve added. So we have two options:

### a) Quickly fix all major bugs and release it as soon as possible, BUT:

* The economy will be locked.
* Leveling will not grant HPoints, which are meant to be exchanged for abilities (a replacement for magic).
* Crafting weapons will not be available.

### b) Release it as it is, which will also allow you to report more bugs. BUT:

* All major systems that are known to be buggy will be locked until they are patched.
* All limitations mentioned in option A will also apply.

This is the only solution I can offer right now. The choice is yours.

Treat it as an Early Access release.

Simply choose with an reactions.
