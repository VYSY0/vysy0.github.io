# VISY0.github.io

## A MAIN WEBSITE FOR VYS'S PROJECTS AND LINKS!

As a developer and a person who know some things about html, css, and javascript i'd rather make my own link tree than usign 3rd party websites full of microtransaction and stuff.

Which is why this website exists.

THIS is my way of updating my community about all of the stuff i'm doing.
